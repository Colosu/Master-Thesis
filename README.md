# Master-Thesis
A repository for the code of my Master Thesis

In this repository you can find all the code I developed in order to get the results for my Master Thesis.
The code is split in the following way:
- MIExp folder: Here is the code for the experiments with succes percentage.
- MIExp2 folder: Here is the code for the experiments with correlation values.
- MIExp3 folder: Here is the code for the experiment to compute execution time.
- MIExp4 folder: Here is the code for the experiments that compare execution times.
- BMIvsTSDm folder: Here is the code for the experiments comparing BMI versus TSDm.
